# Titanic
Kaggle Getting Started Competition
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/

Contains the main python code (Titanic.py) I used to build a simple estimator for Titanic's survival as part of an exercise in Kaggle's Titanic competition. Some ExploratorData Analysis done using Excel and heatmaps, and then directly cleaning and preprocessing the data, followed by a Logistic Regression.

Simplistic code but did it as an exercise. Obtained accuracy of 0.77511 in the competition and ranked an embarrassing 5869 out of 10381, so approx lower than half of the submissions. Oh well it's a good try at least.
